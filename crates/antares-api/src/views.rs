//! The composition hook of endpoint views (ADR-0023, ADR-0027 section 5,
//! T-3494): a request served through a view runs the ordinary handler with
//! one more conjunct, the view's narrowing, composed with whatever the
//! installed engine answers (`effective = view ∧ engine`, both narrowing,
//! neither widening).
//!
//! The view travels on the [`AppState`](crate::AppState)
//! ([`AppState::with_view`](crate::AppState::with_view)), not on the task:
//! everything a request spawns, every in-process call and every join walk
//! clones that state, so no path can lose the view and serve wider than it.
//! `gate!` reads it after the engine has answered and before [`resolve`], so
//! a clause that cannot be narrowed (a write, a purge) is refused under a
//! view exactly as it is under a narrowing engine.
//!
//! Loading, validating and addressing views is `antares-ops`' (T-3496); this
//! module composes one, and holds the table of the views a pod serves
//! ([`ViewTable`]) with the store seam the loader writes through, so the
//! operation layer never names the store (threat F1).
