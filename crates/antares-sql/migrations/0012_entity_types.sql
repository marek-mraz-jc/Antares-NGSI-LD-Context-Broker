-- The type catalogue (T-4683): every type a Tenant's Entities ever carried,
-- one row each, kept by the writes themselves. `/types` and MCP `list_types`
-- read the names here and ask the types index once per name whether a live
-- Entity still carries it, instead of a DISTINCT over every Entity's `types`
-- (66 ms per 100 000 Entities, 30 s and a 503 on a loaded dev).
--
-- Only an insert, or an update that changes `types`, writes; the row of a
-- type already listed is left alone (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` takes no lock
-- on it), so writers of one type never queue on its row. A delete leaves the
-- name; the liveness check hides it, and a Tenant holds few distinct types.
-- Numbered 0012: 0011 is T-4665's, and sqlx applies an unapplied lower
-- version after a higher one.
