# Report-only: no budget fails the run until T-3467's noise profile (ten
# same-commit runs on the pinned perf-weekly instance type,
# docs/src/performance.md) exists; until then a row past its budget is
# reported as `over`. ENFORCE=1 makes such a row fail the run once it
# does. A bench that does not run at all always fails it.
