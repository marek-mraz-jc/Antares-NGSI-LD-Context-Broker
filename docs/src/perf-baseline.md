# Performance baseline

The `perf-baseline` workflow builds the broker twice in one job, a release
binary with overflow checks off and one with them on, and runs the same
shapes (`dev/perf/baseline.sh`: `shapes.sh` at 1 000 and 100 000 entities,
`fire.sh` for subscription fan-out) against each on the memory and the
PostgreSQL store. The two builds share the runner, the dataset and the
hour, so their ratio is the cost of the checks. The absolute numbers are a
shared GitHub `ubuntu-latest` runner's, not a capacity figure: the
[Performance](performance.md) chapter's dedicated-vCPU runs are those. The
job summary of each run names its commit and its CPU.

## 1. The run

| run | commit | runner | artifact |
|---|---|---|---|
| [38135751509](https://github.com/marek-mraz-jc/Antares-NGSI-LD-Context-Broker/actions/runs/38135751509) | `f38a43a` (branch, T-3735) | GitHub `ubuntu-latest` | `perf-baseline` |

Concurrency 50 for every shape; p99 in milliseconds. Each store is
seeded once before its rows, PostgreSQL is vacuumed, analysed and
checkpointed after the seed, and a row measures its shape alone
(`dev/perf/shapes.sh`, T-3735). The tables of run 38078053835 that stood
here counted every row's re-seed as the shape (memory query at 1 000
entities 548 req/s there, 6 122 here) and are withdrawn.

## 5. Overflow checks in release

Release builds check integer overflow (`overflow-checks = true` in
`[profile.release]`, T-3552). The rule was: on, unless p99 or throughput
moves by more than 5 %. On the memory store every row of sections 2 and 3
stays within 5 % (−4.6 % to +3.9 %), and so does every PostgreSQL row at
100 000 entities (+0.7 % to +3.2 %). Three PostgreSQL rows at 1 000
entities move further: query +5.9 % and upsert +8.3 % in favour of the
checks, query-q −41.5 % against them (916 against 536 req/s). The same
query-q at 100 000 entities moves +2.0 %, so the −41.5 % is not the checks'
cost on a smaller dataset; it is one sample this run cannot explain, and
the next run either repeats it or not. The workflow keeps measuring the
cost: its "checks off" binary is built with
`CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_OVERFLOW_CHECKS=false`.

## 6. The budget for a surface

Decided (worker-2, T-3552, owner may override): a surface mounted beside
the NGSI-LD API (`ANTARES_API_SURFACES`) keeps p99 within 10 % and
throughput at 90 % or more of the same request on the NGSI-LD API,
measured in one job as above; a translation layer adds at most 200 µs to
the median.
