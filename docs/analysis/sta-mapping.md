# OGC SensorThings API v1.1 (Sensing, read only) surface: mapping onto `ViewOps` (T-4462)

Sources: OGC SensorThings API Part 1: Sensing v1.1 (OGC 18-088), ISO 19156:2023 (OMS), Antares `antares-ops`
and `antares-ogc`, legacy `context-gateway` (`translators/sta.rs`, `handlers/sta.rs`). The crate is
`crates/antares-sta`; it mounts at `/x/views/{view}/sta/v1.1` (feature and surface name `sta`). The user page is
`docs/src/sta.md`.

## 1. Entity sets

Every read is an operation of the view. Query Entities always names the types the view shows (`type=`, NGSI-LD
5.7.2 takes no query without one); a view of every type reads `local=true`. Entities are read under the core
@context.

| STA set | ISO 19156 concept | NGSI-LD source | Id | Operation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Things` | Host | the Entity | `{urn}` | Query Entities (`id=` for one) |
| `Locations` | the Host's position | its `location` GeoProperty | `{urn}/location` | Query Entities |
| `HistoricalLocations` | a step of the Host's trajectory | each `location` instance with an `observedAt` | `{urn}/historicalLocation/{observedAt}` | Query (set) and Retrieve (one, a Thing's) Temporal Evolution |
| `Datastreams` | ObservationGroup | each instance of a numeric Property | `{urn}/{attribute}`, `{urn}/{attribute}#{datasetId}` | Query Entities |
| `Sensors` | Observer | the `Device` the Entity's `refDevice` points at | the Device's URN | Query Entities by `id` |
| `Observations` | Observation | the current instance; a Datastream's: its history | `{datastream id}/{phenomenonTime}` | Query Entities; Retrieve Temporal Evolution (`lastN`) |
| `ObservedProperties` | ObservableProperty | each measured Attribute | its expanded IRI | Query Entities (`attrs=` for one) |
| `FeaturesOfInterest` | FeatureOfInterest | the target of `refPointOfInterest`, else the Entity's `location` | the target's URN, else `{urn}/location` | Query Entities by `id` |

`{attribute}` is the Attribute's local name: the last segment of the IRI the answer names it by, which is the
term a Smart Data Model and the gateway use. A Datastream's Observations read the Attribute under the name the
view shows whose local name it is.

## 2. Query options

| Option | Bounds | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| `$filter` | at most 4 096 bytes; split on character boundaries only (T-4323) | comparisons, `and`, `or`, parentheses, `substringof` compiled to `q` (the gateway's subset); `not` and any other operator a `400` naming it; on a Datastream's Observations `phenomenonTime` predicates on the top-level `and` become `timerel`/`timeAt`/`endTimeAt`; on a set, `id eq`/`id ne` with a quoted id on the top-level `and` are read by id (`id eq` as the resource by id, `id ne` dropped from the page), never as `q`: an id is no Attribute, and the `q` scanned the whole store (T-4928) |
| `$top` | 1 to 100, default 100 | resources; on `Things`, `Locations`, `Sensors`, `FeaturesOfInterest` (one per Entity) the `limit` of the Query Entities |
| `$skip` | 0 to 10 000 | resources: the `offset` on a set of one per Entity; on `Datastreams`, `Observations`, `ObservedProperties` counted from the first Entity over at most 1 000 Entities, past that a `400` naming `@iot.nextLink`, whose `$skiptoken={entity offset}.{resources of it served}` resumes in one read; on Observations of a Datastream it widens `lastN` |
| `$count` | `true` | `@iot.count`: on `Things` the Query Entities count; on another set only when the page is the whole answer, since an Entity holds several of its resources and the count of those is in no answer |
| `$expand` | depth at most 2 | `Locations`, `Datastreams` inline on a Thing; the current `Observations` on a Datastream (nested options such as `($top=1)` are read past) |
| `$select` | names | the members each resource keeps |
| `$orderby` | `phenomenonTime desc` | newest first on Observations of a Datastream; any other ordering leaves the order as read |

A page is cut at 1 MiB between groups (an Entity, or one resource on a set of several per Entity); a cut page or a
full one carries `@iot.nextLink`, the request's options with the next `$skip` or `$skiptoken`. A resource id appears
once per page.

**phenomenonTime** (mandatory in STA 1.1): the instance's `observedAt`, else the Entity's, else the instance's
`modifiedAt`, else the Entity's (Query Entities reads `options=sysAttrs`). A value no sensor timed, such as the area
of an `AdministrativeArea`, has the time it was last set; an instance with no time is no Observation (EP-13). CI
missed it because every fixture Entity was a sensor with `observedAt` on one instance (T-4928).

## 3. The seven rules and what changed against the gateway

1. **ObservedProperty**: id and `definition` are the Attribute's expanded IRI. The gateway made
   `{urn}/{attribute}` with a definition under the endpoint's own schema, so NO2 at two Entities, views or cities
   were two ObservedProperties; now they are one.
2. **Multi-instance Attributes**: the default instance stays `{urn}/{attribute}`; an instance with a `datasetId`
   is `{urn}/{attribute}#{datasetId}`, and its Observations read only the instances of that dataset. The gateway
   folded every instance into one Datastream.
3. **Sensors**: an Entity of type `Device` (Smart Data Models) that a shown Entity's `refDevice` points at,
   read through the view; `metadata` is its `controlledProperty`. No `refDevice`, or a Device the view hides: no
   Sensor. The gateway answered an empty set.
4. **FeaturesOfInterest**: the target of `refPointOfInterest` with its own URN and location when the view shows
   it, otherwise the Entity's own `location` (`{urn}/location`, the Location's id). An Entity pointing at a hidden
   target has none. A FeatureOfInterest by a URN is that Entity with a location. The gateway answered an empty set.
5. **HistoricalLocations**: the instances of the `location` history with an `observedAt` (moving things: a
   Vehicle). The gateway answered an empty set.
6. **Datastreams and units**: one per instance of a Property whose value is a number;
   `unitOfMeasurement.definition` is `https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/UnitMeasureCode#{unitCode}`. Without a
   `unitCode` the unit is absent, where the gateway answered a unit named `unknown`.
7. **What is absent stays absent** (EP-13): a non-numeric Attribute is no Datastream, a hidden Attribute is in no
   set and its Datastream's Observations are the unknown `404`; no placeholder objects.

## 4. Limits

- A HistoricalLocations page reads the last 100 moves of each Entity; the history of one Thing pages through its
  own list. The broker's temporal Query pages its candidates before the time filter (a short page is not the end),
  so the set reads a full page as "more" and stops at a short one.
- An Observation by id is the current instance; a past one is reached through its Datastream.
- `@iot.count` on a set other than `Things` is omitted past the first page.
- Out of scope: Tasking (Part 2), MultiDatastream, writes, MQTT.
